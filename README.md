## Development

 1. `gem install rake bundler`
    * Installs generic dependencies. Might need to be run with `sudo` depending on your setup.
 2. `bundle install`
    * Install correct versions of project dependencies.
 3. `rake local`
    * Runs a local server on http://localhost:9393. It should auto-restart on each request, so you can keep this command running while you tweak things.
